                    The  Nintendo virtual boy was invented by a Japanese toy maker and video game designer Gumpei Yokoi who was known as creator of the game & watch hand held system.
                      The virtual boy is a 32-bit table top portable video game developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was released July 21st 1995. The game used a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth. Due to failure in sales meeting targets, Nintendo ceased distribution in August 1996 having released only 22 games for the system and sold over 700,000 units.
                     The development of virtual boy lasted about four years and began under the project name ‘VR32’. Nintendo then entered a licensing agreement to use a stereoscopic LED eyepiece technology developed by the US reflection technology in the 1980s. A factory was also built in China mainly for the purpose of virtual boy manufacturing.
                     Over time, the console technology downscaled due to high costs, potential health concerns and a high amount of resources being allocated to the development of the Nintendo 64, (Nintendo’s next home console). The virtual boy was pushed into the market in an unfinished state in 1995 to focus more on Nintendo 64. 
                     The virtual boy gathered a lot of critics along side being a commercial failure even after multiple price drops. It’s failure was attributed to its high price, dark display (consisting only red and black), unimpressive stereoscopic effect, poor ergonomics, lack of true portability and health concerns such as headaches, dizziness, nausea and eye pains. With the ongoing concerns about motion sickness, Nintendo eliminated the head functionality and converted its head mounted goggle design into a stationary, heavy, precision steel shielded, table top firm factor conformant to the recommendation of Schepens Eye Research Institute.
                     “We experimented with a color LCD screen,but the users did not see depth, they just saw doubles. Color graphics give people the impression that a game is high tech, but just because a game has beautiful display doesn’t mean it is fun to play…red uses less battery and is easier to recognize” - Gunpei Yokoi 
                      As a result of increasing competition for internal resources alongside the flagship Nintendo 64 and little involvement from lead designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, virtual boy software was developed without Nintendo’s full attention, however Nintendo pushed the software to the market to focus more on Nintendo 64.
                      The New York Times previewed virtual boy on November 13th 1994, the console was officially announced via press the next day. Nintendo promised that virtual boy would be “ totally immerse players into their own private universe”. The system was demonstrated the next day at Nintendo’s Shoshinkai 1994 trade show and Nintendo of American showed the virtual boy at the consumer electronics show on January 6th 1995.
                     The virtual boy was released on July 21st 1995 in Japan and on August 14th 1995 in North America with the launch games: Mario’s tennis, red alarm, telero boxer and galactic pinball. Nintendo had initially projected sales of three million consoles and 14 million games. The system arrived later than other 32-bit systems like PlayStation, 3DO and Saturn but at a lower price. Nintendo had shipped 350,000 units of virtual boy by December 1995, around three and a half months after its release. The system is number 5 on Game pro’s ‘Top 10 worst selling consoles of all time’ list of 2007.
                      The virtual boy had a short market time span following its disappointing sales. The last game officially released for the virtual boy was 3D Tetris, released March 22nd 1996.  More games were announced for the system at the electronic entertainment expo in May 1996, but these games were never released.
                      The virtual boy was discontinued on December 22nd 1995 in Japan and August 1996 in North America with any announcement. In June 1996,Nintendo reported to Famitsu worldwide sales of 770,000 virtual boy units, including 140,000 in Japan. 
                      Nintendo extensively advertised the virtual boy and claimed to have spent 25 million USD on early promotional activities. Nintendo targeted an older audience with advertisements for virtual boy, shifting away from the traditional child focused approves it had employed in the past. 
                      Challenged by showing 3-dimensional game play on 2-dimensional advertisements, the company partnered with Block buster and NBC. A $5 million campaign promoted NBC’s late 1995 lineup alongside the virtual boy. Even after going as low as $10, virtual boy marketing campaign was considered an epic fail.
                     The CPU is an NEV V810 32-bit RISC chip, making it Nintendo’s first 32-bit system. 
                   The virtual boy uses a pair of 1x224 linear arrays (one per eye) and rapidly scans the arrays across the eye’s field of view using flat oscillatory mirrors. These mirrors vibrate back and forth at a very high speed, thus the mechanical humming noise from inside the unit. Each Virtual Boy game cartridge has a yes/no option to automatically pause every 15–30 minutes so that the player may take a break before any injuries come to the eyes. One speaker per ear provides the player with stereo audio. 
                     The Virtual Boy is the first video game console that was supposed to be capable of displaying stereoscopic "3D" graphics, marketed as a form of virtual reality. Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax. Like using a head-mounted display, the user looks into an eyeshade made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic red image.
                     The display consists of two two-bit (four shade) monochrome red screens of 384×224 pixels and a frame rate of approximately 50.27 Hz. It uses an oscillating mirror to transform a single column of 224 red LEDs into a full field of pixels. Nintendo claimed that a color display would have made "jumpy" images and have been too expensive.
                     The Virtual Boy's heavy emphasis on three-dimensional movement requires the controller to operate along a Z-axis. Its controller is an attempt to implement dual digital D-pads to control elements in the 3D environment. The controller is shaped like an "M", like a Nintendo 64 controller.
                     During development, Nintendo promised the ability to link systems for competitive play. A Virtual Boy link cable was being worked on at Nintendo as late as the third quarter of 1996. The system's EXT (extension) port, located on the underside of the system below the controller port, was never officially supported because no "official" multiplayer games were ever published. Two games were intended to use the EXT port for multiplayer play, but the multiplayer features were removed from Waterworld and Faceball was canceled.
                     Nintendo initially showcased three launch games and planned two or three per month thereafter. Given the system's short lifespan, only 22 games were actually released. Of them, 19 games were released in the Japanese market, and 14 were released in North America.
                      According to Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi had dictated that only a select few third-party developers be shown the Virtual Boy hardware before its formal unveiling, to limit the risk of poor-quality software appearing on the system.
                   When asked if Virtual Boy games were going to be available for download on the Virtual Console for the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé said he could not answer, as he was unfamiliar with the platform. He noted that, given his lack of familiarity, he would be hard-pressed to make the case for the inclusion of the games on the Virtual Console.
                      According to Game Over, Nintendo blamed the machine's faults directly on its creator, Gunpei Yokoi. The commercial failure of the Virtual Boy was reportedly a contributing factor to Yokoi's withdrawal from Nintendo, although he had already planned to retire years prior and then finished the successful Game Boy Pocket, which was released shortly before his departure. Nintendo held that Yokoi's departure was "absolutely coincidental" to the market performance of any Nintendo hardware. The New York Times maintained that Yokoi kept a close relationship with Nintendo. After leaving Nintendo, Yokoi founded his own company, Koto, and collaborated with Bandai to create the WonderSwan, a handheld system competing with the Game Boy.</p>
