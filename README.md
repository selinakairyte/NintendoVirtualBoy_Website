**im going to leave some instructions on how to set up.**


>Initial Set Up

>To begin make sure your signed into **GITHUB** on the **github WEB** and on **VSCODE** .

1. if you have vs code installed
2. open vs code
3. open the source control, its to the left..
4. click clone repository
5. click clone from github
6. enter **selinakairyte/NintendoVirtualBoy_Website**
7. choose a place to save onto your local computer
8. once open you should see all the files on the left in explorer. click on them to view and edit.



>Pushing

   NOW EVERYTIME your satisfied with your work you need to commit and push your changes to github (HERES HOW)
1. go to source control again on left
2. when you make a change you will see a file there
3. click the **plus button** next to the file
4. enter a message(you have to or it wont work)
5. press the downward arrow for commit & push             sidenote:(if you click commit then you need to push it too. click the 3 dots just above that message and click push)



> Double Check ! Check if your changes were pushed  by looking at this page which should be updated.



>Pulling

**Has this page files changed? make sure to PULL the changes onto your code base (click source control and pull) !!!**

**and its recommended to save your files elsewhere if u need to pull then push (in order to not lose work u havent pushed yet)because others changes can override your own if u pull**



(tip - install git as an extension on vscode )



*design however you like!* but **do it on your own file!!!!** dont make it confusing for others
